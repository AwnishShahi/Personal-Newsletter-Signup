# Personal-Newsletter-Signup
Using Mailchimp's API
This webapp will allow the user to subscribe to my personal newsletter. I have used Mailchimp's API in this project along with Express.js to successfully perform backend API requests. User can enter his First Name, Last Name, and email id afer which on successful subscription a feedback of success otherwise a negative feedback will be provided.
